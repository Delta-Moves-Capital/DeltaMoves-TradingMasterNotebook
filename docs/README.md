# Documentation Index – Delta Moves Capital

The `docs` directory contains reference materials, manuals, cheat sheets, and SOPs used across all Delta Moves Capital projects.

This README serves as the index and navigation point for all documentation.

---

## Purpose of the `/docs` Directory
- Centralize all technical and operational documentation.
- Maintain consistent structure and naming conventions.
- Provide quick access to workflows, procedures, and strategy manuals.
- Ensure clean GitHub presentation and future GitHub Pages compatibility.

---

## Documentation Index
Below is the current list of documentation files:

### **Git & Repo Workflow**
- [Git Workflow Cheat Sheet](git-workflow-cheatsheet.md)

*(Additional documentation will be added here as created)*

---

## Conventions for Adding New Documents
- Use lowercase file names with hyphens (e.g., `spx-iron-condor-rotation.md`).
- Place all general-purpose documents in `/docs/`.
- Subdirectories may be used for large categories (e.g., `/docs/trading/`, `/docs/options/`).
- Include a short description at the top of each document.

---

## Recommended Future Additions
These pending items will be added as produced:
- SPX Iron Condor Rotation Manual (GitHub Pages version)
- Wing Width Auto-Calculator documentation
- Decision Trees for Strategy Entry/Exit
- Repo structure guidelines

---

## GitHub Pages Compatibility
This folder is compatible with GitHub Pages if you choose to enable it later:

- `/docs/` can serve as the root for static site documentation.
- Markdown files will render cleanly using GitHub Pages themes.
