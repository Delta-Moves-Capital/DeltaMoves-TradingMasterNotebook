Documentation placeholder for ES futures systems, including future income,
rotation, volatility, and intraday strategies.

This section will eventually contain:

- ES Rotation & Volatility Models
- ES Intraday Frameworks
- Event-based playbooks (CPI, FOMC, NFP)

## Notes
This section is part of the **Futures Trading Notebook** and will expand as new
ES systems are documented.
